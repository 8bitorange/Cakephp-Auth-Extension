This is a component to extend the core Auth component in CakePHP 

created on: May 3rd, 2010

Planned improvements:
allowing convienance method of $this->Auth->user('User.username') or $this->Auth->user('Group.id')
currently only takes first level of array and returns the entire thing ie: $this->Auth->user('Group') will return entire array
